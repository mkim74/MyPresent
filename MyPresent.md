If I'm being honest, my life here at *Mizzou* isn't such a blast, but what can you expect in college? Yea you have more free time and you're away from your parents, but that just means you have more responsibilty to get your ~~shit~~ done. This is my first year doing Python/HTML/Javascript because I changed major from Computer Science to Information Technology last year (no, they are not the same thing). I spend my outside of class time playing *League of Legends* with my hometown friends and sometimes going to the rec to workout and play basketball. During my alone time, I love to watch K-dramas and anime with the LED lights on. Although I love my time at home, I'm loving it here on campus more.
